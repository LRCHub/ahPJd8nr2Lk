```lrc
[00:31.91] Another dream will slip away
[00:34.27] The vision inside my head 色褪せた
[00:41.72] A sea of sorrow fades to gray
[00:45.33] 溺れていたいと思った
[00:51.23] 羅針盤が指したのは 瞳の奥
[00:59.08] Where my tears will rain in blue
[01:01.85] Can you take me away from the misery in my mind
[01:06.79] I hear the voices 叫んでる a pain inside ただ思い出して
[01:12.64] Can you take me away to the place where I can find
[01:17.79] A never ending story
[01:20.27] 息止めて dive in your eyes
[01:31.27] 
[01:33.08] An empty canvas in the sky
[01:37.28] The colors inside my heart 塗りつぶした
[01:43.40] I stretch my wings and try to fly
[01:47.53] A memory holds me back 落ちてく
[01:53.27] 空回る物語 たった一つの answer scars me deep
[02:04.06] I search for the horizon, for dawn to end this night
[02:09.56] I see the answers 描いてる the light inside ただ追いかけて
[02:14.51] And when I'm finally standing where shadow meets the light
[02:19.65] It's a brand new story
[02:22.02] 鮮やかに dive in your eyes
[02:33.02] 
[02:46.58] Time will gently pass inside a dream
[02:52.21] 夜を数えてまた待ってる
[02:58.15] Quietly as I flip the hourglass 忘れてゆく温もり
[03:14.18] Can you take me away from the misery in my mind
[03:18.93] I feel a hope 響いてる a fear inside 切り裂いて
[03:24.19] Can you take me away to the place where I can find
[03:29.25] A never ending story
[03:31.66] 息止めて dive...
[03:34.21] How far is the horizon, the dawn beyond this night
[03:39.48] It's a brand new story, I keep on searching
[03:44.67] A never ending story
[03:47.09] Take a breath and I'll dive in your eyes...
